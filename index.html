        <p>Hey! My name is Emmy :). My pronouns are she/her/hers and I'm from St. Louis, MO. I am a CTD major with a Computer Science minor, and I'm interested in visual effects for movie production and virtual reality.</p>
        <p>Fun Fact: Web design was actually my first ever coding class I took my sophomore year of high school, so it's cool to come full circle.</p>

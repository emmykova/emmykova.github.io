        <p>Hey! My name is Emmy :). My pronouns are she/her/hers and I'm from St. Louis, MO.</p> 
        <p>I am a CTD major with a Computer Science minor, and I'm interested in visual effects for movie production and virtual reality.</p>
        <p>Fun Fact: Web design was actually my first ever coding class I took my sophomore year of high school, so it's cool to come full circle.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to re-learn html and have that knowledge to use in the future.</p>
        <p>Here is my <a href="https://youtu.be/hFZFjoX2cGg" target="_blank"> favorite youtube video</a></p>
